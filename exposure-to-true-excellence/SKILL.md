# Exposure to True Excellence

## Overview

Gagan Biyani (Udemy founder) says the challenge for most people who want to become great is that they never even meet true greatness — finding "bar setters" is the first job.

## When to Use

- Choosing where to work
- Seeking mentors
- Building your network
- Evaluating opportunities
- Planning career growth

## The Bar Setter Problem

```
Can't become 10x if you've never seen 10x

Without exposure to excellence:
- Don't know what's possible
- Can't recognize greatness
- Set standards too low
- Plateau early
```

## Why This Matters

### The Invisible Ceiling

**Scenario 1: No Bar Setters**
```
You: "I'm a good engineer"
Reality: Best in small company
Actual level: 60th percentile globally
Ceiling: Never see what great looks like
```

**Scenario 2: With Bar Setters**
```
You: "I'm a good engineer"
Work with 95th percentile engineer
Realize: "Oh, THIS is great"
Ceiling: Raised by 3-5x
```

### The Recognition Gap

Most people can't recognize excellence because they've never experienced it.

```
Bad code → Looks fine if you've only seen bad code
Good code → Looks great until you see excellent code
Excellent code → Only recognized by those who've seen it
```

## Finding Bar Setters

### Level 1: Recognize the Gap

Ask yourself:
- Have I worked with someone truly exceptional?
- Do I know what world-class looks like in my field?
- Can I articulate what makes someone 10x?
- Am I the best engineer I know? (Red flag)

### Level 2: Seek Exposure

```
Priority order:
1. Work directly with excellent people (highest bandwidth)
2. Study their work closely (code, talks, writing)
3. Learn from their thinking (interviews, blogs)
4. Read about them (books, articles)
```

### Level 3: Learn from Exposure

Don't just be around excellence - study it:
- How do they think?
- What do they prioritize?
- How do they approach problems?
- What standards do they hold?

## Where to Find Bar Setters

### Option 1: Join Great Companies ✅

**Top tier for engineering excellence:**
- Google, Meta, Amazon (infrastructure scale)
- Stripe, Airbnb, Uber (product engineering)
- OpenAI, Anthropic (AI frontier)
- Netflix, Spotify (specific domains)

**Why it works:**
- Bar is high by default
- Surrounded by excellent engineers
- Learn through osmosis
- Standards are built-in

### Option 2: Join Startups with Great People

**Look for:**
- Founders from FAANG/unicorns
- Early engineers from successful companies
- Strong technical advisors
- Impressive early team

**Due diligence:**
```
Questions to ask:
- Who are your best engineers?
- Where did they come from?
- Who are your technical advisors?
- What's your code review culture like?
```

### Option 3: Open Source Projects

**Projects led by bar setters:**
- Linux (Linus Torvalds)
- React (Meta team)
- Kubernetes (Google background)
- PyTorch (Meta Research)

**How to learn:**
- Read code reviews
- Study design docs
- Understand decisions
- Contribute

### Option 4: Online Communities

**High-signal communities:**
- Hacker News (startups, tech)
- Specific subreddits (r/ExperiencedDevs)
- Discord servers (specific to tech)
- Twitter following right people

### Option 5: Conferences & Events

**Value tiers:**
1. Small, curated events (highest signal)
2. Technical conferences (good talks)
3. Large conferences (networking)

**Pro tip:** Hallway track > sessions

## Recognizing Excellence

### In Code

❌ Not excellent:
```python
# Works but messy
def f(x,y):
    return x*2+y if x>0 else y*2
```

✅ Excellent:
```python
# Clear, intentional, maintainable
def calculate_weighted_sum(base: float, weight: float) -> float:
    """Apply weight to base, with special handling for negative values."""
    if base > 0:
        return base * POSITIVE_WEIGHT + weight
    else:
        return weight * NEGATIVE_WEIGHT
```

**What makes it excellent:**
- Clear naming
- Explicit intent
- Maintainable
- Documented assumptions

### In System Design

❌ Not excellent:
```
Problem: Need authentication
Solution: Copy-paste from tutorial
Result: Works but not scalable
```

✅ Excellent:
```
Problem: Need authentication
Solution:
1. Research patterns (OAuth, JWT, sessions)
2. Evaluate trade-offs
3. Design for scale
4. Plan for evolution
5. Implement with examples
Result: Production-ready, extensible system
```

### In Problem Solving

❌ Not excellent:
```
Problem appears → Try random solutions → Eventually works
```

✅ Excellent:
```
Problem appears →
1. Understand root cause
2. Consider approaches
3. Evaluate trade-offs
4. Implement systematically
5. Verify solution
```

### In Communication

❌ Not excellent:
```
"This code is broken"
```

✅ Excellent:
```
"This code has a race condition at line 42.
When X and Y happen concurrently, Z fails.
Here's a reproduction case and proposed fix."
```

## The Learning Process

### Stage 1: Observe

Watch how they work:
- How do they approach problems?
- What do they read?
- How do they debug?
- What do they prioritize?

### Stage 2: Compare

Compare to your approach:
- What do they do differently?
- Why is their way better?
- What can I adopt?
- What are the principles?

### Stage 3: Practice

Apply their patterns:
- Try their techniques
- Adopt their standards
- Practice deliberately
- Get feedback

### Stage 4: Internalize

Make it your own:
- Understand the why
- Adapt to your context
- Develop intuition
- Teach others

## Red Flags in Seeking Excellence

### False Bar Setters

Avoid these traps:

❌ **Loudest voice:** Confident ≠ Competent
❌ **Most senior:** Title ≠ Excellence
❌ **Most verbose:** Complexity ≠ Quality
❌ **Most opinionated:** Strong opinions ≠ Right answers

✅ Look for:
- Results that speak
- Code that's referenced
- Respect from peers
- Clear thinking

### Cargo Culting

```
Wrong: "They use microservices, so we should too"
Right: "They use microservices because of X constraints.
       We have Y constraints, so we should do Z"
```

Learn principles, not patterns.

## Building Your Bar Setter Network

### 1. Identify Your Bar Setters

```markdown
## My Bar Setters

### Technical Excellence
- [Name]: Amazing at system design
- [Name]: Code quality exemplar
- [Name]: Performance optimization genius

### Product Thinking

## Measuring Progress

You're getting exposure when:
- Your standards are rising
- What seemed good now seems average
- You can articulate what makes something excellent
- You're uncomfortable with mediocrity
- You're pushing yourself harder

## The Investment

```
Cost of exposure to excellence:
- Time to seek them out
- Possibly lower salary
- Ego hits (realizing you're not as good as you thought)
- Hard work to keep up

Value of exposure:
- Faster growth trajectory
- Higher ceiling
- Better opportunities
- Elevated standards

ROI: 10-100x over career
```

## Remember

**"You can't be what you can't see"**

- Most people never see world-class
- Finding bar setters is the first job
- Exposure accelerates growth
- Standards compound over time

**Your career ceiling is set by the best people you work with.**

Choose your exposure carefully. It shapes your trajectory more than almost anything else.
